# Task Management System with React.js and Tailwind CSS

A simple and intuitive Task Management System built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. This application allows users to manage tasks efficiently by providing features such as task creation, deletion, updating, and sorting based on priority. The tasks are stored locally in the browser's storage.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Easily add new tasks with a user-friendly modal interface.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Task Update**: Modify task details using the editing functionality.
- **Priority Sorting**: Arrange tasks based on priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
- **Beautiful Task Interface**: Stylishly designed using Tailwind CSS for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing modern and responsive UIs.
- **Local Storage**: Utilizes browser local storage to persistently store task data.

## Design Choices
- React.js: Chosen for its declarative syntax, component-based structure, and virtual DOM for efficient updates.
- Tailwind CSS: Utilized for rapid styling with a utility-first approach, resulting in a clean and modern UI.
- Local Storage: Leveraged to store tasks locally in the user's browser, ensuring persistence across sessions.
- Modal Interface: Implemented a modal for task creation and editing, providing a seamless and focused user experience.
